			###########Pokémon Dataset Processing and Visualization###########

>>>This project processes a Pokémon dataset, creates a SQLite database, and generates visualizations using Plotly. The code includes two workflows:

	1.Without Kaggle Account: Reads a local CSV file, processes data, saves it to a SQLite database, generates SQL 		files, 	and creates visualizations (bar, scatter, line, and histogram).

	2.With Kaggle Account: Downloads the dataset using Kaggle API, performs similar processing, and generates outputs.

>>>Features:
	1.Dynamic Paths: Uses os for directory management and ensures portability.
	2.Data Processing: Converts datasets, saves to SQLite, and creates SQL scripts.
	3.Visualization: Generates interactive graphs (bar, scatter, line, histogram) with Plotly.
	4.Directory Management: Automatically creates required directories for outputs.
>>>Outputs:
	1.Cleaned CSV
	2.SQLite database
	3.SQL file with table creation and insertion scripts
	4.Graphs as HTML files
>>>Requirements:
	1.Python 3.x
	2.Libraries: pandas, sqlite3, plotly, os
	3.Optional: Kaggle API for dataset download
